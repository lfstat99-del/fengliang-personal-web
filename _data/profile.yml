  <p>
  My primary research interests lie in <b>mediation analysis</b>, particularly in developing adaptive tests for composite mediation effects in challenging settings such as high-dimensional mediators, the presence of
  unmeasured confounding, and nonlinear outcome or mediator models. I am also interested in <b>independence
  testing/conditional independence testing/conditional mean independence testing</b> and its generalization to detecting conditional average treatment effects (CATE). In addition, I also focus on <b>high-dimensional statistical inference and causal machine learning</b>.
